# Service Card District Display Implementation

## Completed Tasks

### Backend Changes
- [x] Added transient `district` field to Service entity
- [x] Injected UserProfileRepository in ServiceService
- [x] Created `populateDistricts` method to fetch and set district from user profiles
- [x] Updated `getAllApprovedServices` to populate districts
- [x] Updated `searchApprovedServices` to populate districts
- [x] Updated `getServicesByCategory` to populate districts
- [x] Updated `getApprovedServiceById` to populate district for single service

### Frontend Changes
- [x] Confirmed ServiceCard.jsx displays district dynamically
- [x] Added district display to Complete ServiceCard.jsx

## Summary
The service cards now display the district from the service provider's profile instead of hardcoded values. The backend fetches the district from the UserProfile entity and populates it in the Service entity before sending to the frontend. The frontend components are updated to display this district information.

## Testing Required
- Verify that service providers have their addressDistrict set in their profiles
- Test that services display the correct district on the frontend
- Check that the district updates when the profile is updated
