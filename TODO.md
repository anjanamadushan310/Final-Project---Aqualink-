# Fix Service Provider Dashboard 403 Forbidden Error

## Issue
- User getting 403 Forbidden error when trying to add a service in ServiceProviderDashboard.jsx
- Error occurs because the logged-in user doesn't have the SERVICE_PROVIDER role
- ServiceProviderController has @PreAuthorize("hasRole('SERVICE_PROVIDER')") which blocks access

## Root Cause
- User registered with a different role (not SERVICE_PROVIDER)
- The backend requires SERVICE_PROVIDER role to access service provider endpoints
- No role update functionality exists in the system

## Solution
- User needs to register a new account and select SERVICE_PROVIDER role during registration
- RegistrationForm.jsx allows selecting multiple roles including SERVICE_PROVIDER
- No backend changes needed - this is expected behavior

## Tasks
- [x] Identified root cause: User lacks SERVICE_PROVIDER role
- [x] Confirmed registration process supports SERVICE_PROVIDER role selection
- [x] Provided solution: Register new account with SERVICE_PROVIDER role
