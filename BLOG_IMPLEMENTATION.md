   - Image upload and management
   - Comment moderation

2. **Public Blog Pages**

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### Entity Models
1. **BlogPost**
   - Core entity for storing blog content
   - Stores title, content, images, and publication status
   - Tracks created/updated timestamps
   - Maintains relationships with User, Comments and Reactions

2. **BlogComment**
   - Stores user comments on blog posts
   - Includes approval status for moderation
   - Links to both the blog post and the commenting user

3. **BlogReaction**
   - Tracks user likes and dislikes
   - Enforces unique constraint per user-post pair
   - Uses ReactionType enum for reaction types

#### Repository Layer
- BlogPostRepository: CRUD operations for blog posts
- BlogCommentRepository: CRUD operations for comments
- BlogReactionRepository: CRUD operations for reactions

#### Service Layer
- BlogService: Business logic for blog functionality
- Comment approval workflow
- Reaction management logic

#### Controller Layer
- RESTful API endpoints for blog operations
- Security constraints using Spring Security
- Pagination support for efficient data loading

### Frontend Components

#### Exporter Dashboard Integration
- Blog management tab in exporter dashboard
- Blog post listings with action buttons
- Create/edit forms for blog posts

#### Blog Creation Interface
- Rich text editor using TinyMCE
- Image upload and preview functionality
- Draft/publish toggle

#### Public Blog Pages

## Data Transfer Objects

- BlogPostDto: For transferring blog post data
- BlogCommentDto: For transferring comment data
- BlogReactionDto: For transferring reaction data

## Security Considerations

- Exporters can only edit/delete their own blog posts
- Comment moderation requires exporter role
- Authentication required for commenting and reactions
- Public read access for published blog posts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Content Management**
   - Tags and categories for blog posts
   - Featured posts functionality
   - Related posts suggestions

2. **User Experience**
   - Comment notifications

3. **Analytics**
   - View tracking for blog posts
   - Performance metrics for exporters
   - Engagement statistics

## Conclusion
The blog component provides a comprehensive system for exporters to engage with users through informative content. It supports rich media, user interactions, and moderation capabilities while maintaining a clean separation of concerns in both the backend and frontend implementation.
